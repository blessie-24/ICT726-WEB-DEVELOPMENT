# Local Environment

><p style="text-indent: 30px; text-align: justify;">Since we're developing in a local environment using tools like XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP, or similar, it's crucial to keep our setup consistent throughout the project. This approach helps ensure that everything runs smoothly and aligns closely with how the final deployment will behave.</p>

To maintain consistency and ensure your website works properly, we strongly recommend verifying that all links are functional and follow the same structure on your home machine.</p>
